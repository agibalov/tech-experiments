Learning OpenTelemetry.

## How to do things

* `docker compose up` to launch LGTM stack. Web console will be available at http://localhost:3000
* `uv run uvicorn main:app --reload` to launch web app. App will be available at http://localhost:8000
* `./run.sh` to launch web app, but *in a different way* :-D (TODO: clean up this mess)
