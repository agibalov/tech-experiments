Learning how GraphQL/Apollo make BE/FE integration more straightforward.

* `yarn graphql-codegen` to generate TS from `shared/todos.graphql`
* `yarn test` to run tests
* `yarn build` to build BE and FE
* `yarn start` to start the app after build
* `yarn watch` to start BE and FE in watch mode
* `yarn lint` to lint BE and FE
* `docker-compose up --build` to build a Docker image and run it.
